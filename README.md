👋 Hi, I’m @bombfriedrice, also known as RJ. I'm a passionate innovator at the intersection of food, tech, music, and art.

👀 I’m interested in transforming the dining experience by infusing it with technology and creativity. My project revolves around building an immersive, multi-sensory experience for food lovers.

🌱 I’m currently developing an app that leverages AR and AI technologies to help restaurants create and share value. The goal is to build a shared network that enriches both the customer experience and business operations.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with tech enthusiasts, culinary artists, musicians, and creators who are excited about redefining the traditional dining experience.

📫 You can reach me through my website at bombfriedrice.com, or connect with me on LinkedIn.
